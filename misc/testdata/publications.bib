 author={<jit> and <annal> and <vinayakp> and <me>},
 booktitle={<<proc>> 25th <<soda>> (SODA14)},
 year={2014},
 abstract={The problem of computing the minimum number of flips to transform one triangulation of a convex polygon to another is not known to be in P or NP-complete.
A flip sequence determines a one-to-one correspondence between the edges of the two triangulations.
As a step towards understanding the source of difficulty, we investigate the problem
when this edge correspondence is given, i.e., we want the flip distance between two edge labelled triangulations of a convex polygon.

We give tight worst case bounds of $\Theta(n \log n)$ on the flip distance between edge labelled triangulations of a convex polygon, and edge-labelled combinatorial triangulations, in contrast to the $\Theta(n)$ bounds for the unlabelled case.
Our method is to reduce to sorting with restricted operations similar to the length-weighted reversals relevant in comparative genomics.  Our bounds imply a lower bound on a very general model of sorting that subsumes a previously known lower bound.

We give an $O(\log n)$-factor approximation algorithm for computing the flip distance between edge labelled triangulations of a convex polygon.

We also consider simultaneous flips on edge-labelled triangulations. We prove an $O(\log^2 n)$ upper bound and an $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound on the worst case number of simultaneous flips, in contrast with the tight bound of $\Theta(\log n)$ for the unlabelled case proved in SODA '06.},

 abstract={For a set of points in the plane and a fixed integer $k > 0$, the Yao graph $Y_k$ partitions the space around each point into $k$ equiangular cones, and connects each point to a nearest neighbor in each cone. With the exception of $Y_5$, it is known for all Yao graphs whether or not they are geometric spanners. In this paper we resolve this gap and show that $Y_5$ is a $t$-spanner with spanning ratio $t$ less than 10.9. We also improve the known spanning ratio of all the Yao graphs for odd $k > 5$. Finally, we revisit the $Y_6$ graph, which plays a particularly important role as the transition between the graphs ($k > 6$) for which simple inductive proofs are known, and the graphs ($k \le 6$) whose best spanning ratios are established by complex arguments. Here we reduce the known spanning ratio of $Y_6$ from $17.6$ to $5.8$.},

Finally, we show that the number of edges in a theta graph of points uniformly distributed in a square is concentrated around its expected value.},

  abstract={We present improved upper bounds on the spanning ratio of a large family of $\theta$-graphs. A $\theta$-graph partitions the plane around each vertex into $m$ disjoint cones, each having aperture $\theta = 2 \pi/m$. We show that for any integer $k \geq 1$, $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 4$ cones have spanning ratio at most $1 + 2 \sin(\theta/2) / (\cos(\theta/2) - \sin(\theta/2))$. We also show that $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 3$ and $4k + 5$ cones have spanning ratio at most $\cos (\theta/4) / (\cos (\theta/2) - \sin (3\theta/4))$. This is a significant improvement on all families of $\theta$-graphs for which exact bounds are not known. For example, the spanning ratio of the $\theta$-graph with 7 cones is decreased from at most 7.5625 to at most 3.5132. We also improve the upper bounds on the competitiveness of the $\theta$-routing algorithm for these graphs to $1 + 2 \sin(\theta/2) / (\cos(\theta/2) - \sin(\theta/2))$ on $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 4$ cones and to $1 + 2 \sin(\theta/2) \cdot \cos (\theta/4) / (\cos (\theta/2) - \sin (3\theta/4))$ on $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 3$ and $4k + 5$ cones. For example, the routing ratio of the $\theta$-graph with 7 cones is decreased from at most 7.5625 to at most 4.0490.},

In a slightly stronger model, where in addition to the neighbourhood of each vertex, we store $O(1)$ additional information, we show how to find a path that has length at most $15/\sqrt{3}$ times the Euclidean distance both in a 6-spanner of maximum degree 12 and a 6-spanner of maximum degree 9.},

  abstract={A rectangular cartogram is a type of map where every region is a rectangle. The size of the rectangles is chosen such that their areas represent a geographic variable such as population or GDP. In recent years several algorithms for the automated construction of rectangular cartograms have been proposed, some of which are based on rectangular duals of the dual graph of the input map. In this paper we present a new approach to efficiently search within the exponentially large space of all possible rectangular duals. We employ  evolution strategies that find rectangular duals which can be used for rectangular cartograms with correct adjacencies and (close to) zero cartographic error. This is a considerable improvement upon previous methods that have to either relax adjacency requirements or deal with larger errors. We present extensive experimental results for a large variety of data sets.},

  title={Making triangulations 4-connected using flips},
  year={2011},
  month={December},
  address={Eindhoven University of Technology},
  abstract={An edge flip is an operation that transforms one triangulation into another by replacing the diagonal of the quadrilateral formed by two adjacent triangles with the other possible diagonal. One of the most natural questions to ask, is whether this allows us to transform any given triangulation into any other (with the same number of vertices). This question was answered affirmatively by Wagner, when he introduced the flip operation in 1936. The next logical question then is, how many flips does this take? Careful analysis of Wagner's proof shows that a number of flips quadratic in the number of vertices certainly suffices. However, more recently, Komuro showed that a linear number of flips suffices as well and Mori et al. improved this bound further to $6n - 30$ flips. Their algorithm consists of two steps; it first makes the given triangulation 4-connected and then transforms the result into a fixed canonical triangulation. We give a tight bound of $(3n - 7)/5$ flips on the first step and improve the second step to match the existing lower bound of $2n - 15$ flips, resulting in a new upper bound of $5.2n - 30.8$ flips.},

In addition, for $n \geq 19$, we improve the upper bound on the number of flips required to transform any 4-connected triangulation into the canonical triangulation (the triangulation with two dominant vertices), matching the known lower bound of $2n - 15$. Our results imply a new upper bound on the diameter of the flip graph of $5.2 n - 33.6$, improving on the previous best known bound of $6n - 30$.},

The half-$\theta_6$-graph is identical to the Delaunay triangulation where the empty region is an equilateral triangle. Moreover, we show that no local routing scheme can achieve a better competitive spanning ratio thereby implying that our routing scheme is optimal. This is somewhat surprising because the spanning ratio of the half-$\theta_6$-graph is 2. Since every triangulation can be embedded in the plane as a half-$\theta_6$-graph using $O(\log n)$ bits per vertex coordinate via Schnyder's embedding scheme (SODA 1990), our result provides a competitive local routing scheme for every such embedded triangulation.},

  abstract={Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and let $r$ be a parameter with $1 \leq r \leq n$. A rectilinear $r$-partition for $S$ is a collection $\Psi(S) := \{(S_1, b_1), \dots , (S_t, b_t)\}$, such that the sets $S_i$ form a partition of $S$, each $b_i$ is the bounding box of $S_i$, and $n/2r \leq |S_i| \leq 2n/r$ for all $1 \leq i \leq t$. The (rectilinear) stabbing number of $\Psi(S)$ is the maximum number of bounding boxes in $\Psi(S)$ that are intersected by an axis-parallel hyperplane $h$. We study the problem of finding an optimal rectilinear $r$-partition - a rectilinear partition with minimum stabbing number - for a given set $S$. We obtain the following results.<br>
- Computing an optimal partition is NP-hard already in $\mathbb{R}^2$.<br>
- There are point sets such that any partition with disjoint bounding boxes has stabbing number $\Omega(r^{1-1/d})$, while the optimal partition has stabbing number 2.<br>
- An exact algorithm to compute optimal partitions, running in polynomial time if $r$ is a constant, and a faster 2-approximation algorithm.<br>
- An experimental investigation of various heuristics for computing rectilinear $r$-partitions in $\mathbb{R}^2$.},

We also give an example of a triangulation that requires $\lceil(3n - 10)/5\rceil$ flips to be made 4-connected, showing that our bound is tight. Our result implies a new upper bound on the diameter of the flip graph of $5.2 n - 24.4$, improving on the bound of $6n -30$ by Mori et al.},

Rectangular duals find applications in various areas: as floor plans of electronic chips, in architectural designs, as rectangular cartograms, or as treemaps. An irreducible triangulation can have many RELs and hence many rectangular duals. Depending on the specific application different duals might be desirable.

  abstract={A regular edge labeling of an irreducible triangulation $G$ uniquely defines a rectangular dual of $G$. Rectangular duals find applications in various areas: as floor plans of electronic chips, in architectural designs, as rectangular cartograms, or as treemaps. An irreducible triangulation
can have many regular edge labelings and hence many rectangular duals. Depending on the specific application different duals might be desirable. In this thesis we consider optimization problems on regular edge labelings and show how to find optimal or near-optimal ones for various quality criteria. We evaluate our optimization methods by applying them to generate high quality rectangular cartograms. Furthermore, we show how to efficiently enumerate
the regular edge labelings of an irreducible triangulation. Since the running time of the enumeration algorithm depends on the number of regular edge labelings, we also consider the maximal number of regular edge labelings an irreducible triangulation can have. We show that every irreducible triangulation with $n$ vertices has less than $O(4.6807^n)$ regular edge labelings and that there are irreducible triangulations with $\Omega(3.0426^n)$ regular edge labelings.},
