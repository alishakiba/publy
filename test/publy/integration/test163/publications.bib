 abstract={Theta graphs are important geometric graphs that have many applications, including wireless networking, motion planning, real-time animation, and minimum-spanning tree construction. We give closed form expressions for the average degree of theta graphs of a homogeneous Poisson point process over the plane. We then show that essentially the same bounds—with vanishing error terms—hold for theta graphs of finite sets of points that are uniformly distributed in a square. Finally, we show that the number of edges in a theta graph of points uniformly distributed in a square is concentrated around its expected value.},

  abstract={We present improved upper bounds on the spanning ratio of a large family of $\theta$-graphs. A $\theta$-graph partitions the plane around each vertex into $m$ disjoint cones, each having aperture $\theta = 2 \pi/m$. We show that for any integer $k \geq 1$, $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 4$ cones have spanning ratio at most $1 + 2 \sin(\theta/2) / (\cos(\theta/2) - \sin(\theta/2))$. We also show that $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 3$ and $4k + 5$ cones have spanning ratio at most $\cos (\theta/4) / (\cos (\theta/2) - \sin (3\theta/4))$. This is a significant improvement on all families of $\theta$-graphs for which exact bounds are not known. For example, the spanning ratio of the $\theta$-graph with 7 cones is decreased from at most 7.5625 to at most 3.5132. We also improve the upper bounds on the competitiveness of the $\theta$-routing algorithm for these graphs to $1 + 2 \sin(\theta/2) / (\cos(\theta/2) - \sin(\theta/2))$ on $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 4$ cones and to $1 + 2 \sin(\theta/2) \cdot \cos (\theta/4) / (\cos (\theta/2) - \sin (3\theta/4))$ on $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 3$ and $4k + 5$ cones. For example, the routing ratio of the $\theta$-graph with 7 cones is decreased from at most 7.5625 to at most 4.0490.}

In a slightly stronger model, where in addition to the neighbourhood of each vertex, we store $O(1)$ additional information, we show how to find a path that has length at most $15/\sqrt{3}$ times the Euclidean distance both in a 6-spanner of maximum degree 12 and a 6-spanner of maximum degree 9.},

We also show that $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 4$ cones have spanning ratio at least $1 + 2 \tan(\theta/2) + 4 \tan^2(\theta/2)$. This is somewhat surprising since, for equal values of $k$, the spanning ratio of $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 4$ cones is greater than that of $\theta$-graphs with $4k + 2$ cones, showing that increasing the number of cones can make the spanning ratio worse.}

  abstract={A rectangular cartogram is a type of map where every region is a rectangle. The size of the rectangles is chosen such that their areas represent a geographic variable such as population or GDP. In recent years several algorithms for the automated construction of rectangular cartograms have been proposed, some of which are based on rectangular duals of the dual graph of the input map. In this paper we present a new approach to efficiently search within the exponentially large space of all possible rectangular duals. We employ  evolution strategies that find rectangular duals which can be used for rectangular cartograms with correct adjacencies and (close to) zero cartographic error. This is a considerable improvement upon previous methods that have to either relax adjacency requirements or deal with larger errors. We present extensive experimental results for a large variety of data sets.},

  address={Eindhoven University of Technology},
  abstract={An edge flip is an operation that transforms one triangulation into another by replacing the diagonal of the quadrilateral formed by two adjacent triangles with the other possible diagonal. One of the most natural questions to ask, is whether this allows us to transform any given triangulation into any other (with the same number of vertices). This question was answered affirmatively by Wagner, when he introduced the flip operation in 1936. The next logical question then is, how many flips does this take? Careful analysis of Wagner's proof shows that a number of flips quadratic in the number of vertices certainly suffices. However, more recently, Komuro showed that a linear number of flips suffices as well and Mori et al. improved this bound further to $6n - 30$ flips. Their algorithm consists of two steps; it first makes the given triangulation 4-connected and then transforms the result into a fixed canonical triangulation. We give a tight bound of $(3n - 7)/5$ flips on the first step and improve the second step to match the existing lower bound of $2n - 15$ flips, resulting in a new upper bound of $5.2n - 30.8$ flips.},

In addition, for $n \geq 19$, we improve the upper bound on the number of flips required to transform any 4-connected triangulation into the canonical triangulation (the triangulation with two dominant vertices), matching the known lower bound of $2n - 15$. Our results imply a new upper bound on the diameter of the flip graph of $5.2 n - 33.6$, improving on the previous best known bound of $6n - 30$.},

The half-$\theta_6$-graph is identical to the Delaunay triangulation where the empty region is an equilateral triangle. Moreover, we show that no local routing scheme can achieve a better competitive spanning ratio thereby implying that our routing scheme is optimal. This is somewhat surprising because the spanning ratio of the half-$\theta_6$-graph is 2. Since every triangulation can be embedded in the plane as a half-$\theta_6$-graph using $O(\log n)$ bits per vertex coordinate via Schnyder's embedding scheme (SODA 1990), our result provides a competitive local routing scheme for every such embedded triangulation.},

A rectilinear $r$-partition for $S$ is a collection $\Psi(S) := \{(S_1, b_1), \dots , (S_t, b_t)\}$, such that the sets $S_i$ form a partition of $S$, each $b_i$ is the bounding box of $S_i$, and $n/2r \leq |S_i| \leq 2n/r$ for all $1 \leq i \leq t$. The (rectilinear) stabbing number of $\Psi(S)$ is the maximum number of bounding boxes in $\Psi(S)$ that are intersected by an axis-parallel hyperplane $h$. We study the problem of finding an optimal rectilinear $r$-partition - a rectilinear partition with minimum stabbing number - for a given set $S$. We obtain the following results.<br>
- Computing an optimal partition is NP-hard already in $\mathbb{R}^2$.<br>
- There are point sets such that any partition with disjoint bounding boxes has stabbing number $\Omega(r^{1-1/d})$, while the optimal partition has stabbing number 2.<br>
- An exact algorithm to compute optimal partitions, running in polynomial time if $r$ is a constant, and a faster 2-approximation algorithm.<br>
